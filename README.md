This is a collection of figlet fonts based on graffiti handstyles by a number of artists. 

You can test these [here](http://patorjk.com/figlet-editor/#/edit) by selecting "Import" and pasting the contents of any of these files into the test box. 

Currently, font1 only supports uppercase, and font2 supports both upper and lower case. These are both test fonts I made using generic hand styles. More to come soon!

==Future Features==
* Multiple fonts with different sizes
* Engine for combining specific characters for custom fonts using the glyphs in this collection
